# Rent-It-Now
Rent It Now is a backend-driven rental management system developed using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA, designed to streamline short-term product rentals. The system supports key backend functionalities such as product management, cart handling, order placement, and return processing for a wide range of rental items including clothing, electronics, and vehicles.
Built with a modular RESTful architecture, the backend separates concerns through clean controller-service-repository layers, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Admins can perform CRUD operations on products, while users can search, add items to cart, specify rental durations, and place orders.
This project demonstrates efficient backend design for real-world applications, laying a solid foundation for integration with any frontend or mobile interface to create a complete rentalÂ platform.
